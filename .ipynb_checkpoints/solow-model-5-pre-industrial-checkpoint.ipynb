We do this by setting the rate of efficiency of labor growth $ g $ equal to the difference between the rate $ h $ at which economically useful ideas are generated, and the rate of population and labor force growth $ n $ divided by an effect-of-resource scarcity parameter $ \\gamma $, because a higher population makes natural resources per capita increasingly scarce.

This captures the idea that even though human technology was advancing over the ten millennia before the Industrial Revolution, living standards were not because the potential benefits from technology and organization for productivity were offset by the productivity-diminishing effects of smaller farm sizes and more costly other natural resources to feed and provide for the growing population. \n",
