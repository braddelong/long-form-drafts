    "70,000 years ago, back in the Old Stone Age, there were perhaps 100,000 of _us_—100,000 East African Plains Apes who looked like us, moved like us, acted like us, talked like us, and from whom the overwhelming proportion of all of our heredity is derived. Yes, we have small admixtures (5%?) from other groups and subspecies and may be even species, but overwhelmingly we are those proto-hundred-thousand's children, and we are all all of their children: it is overwhelmingly likely that each of those who still has living descendants today has a place—has an astronomical number of places—on our <http://ancestry.com> family tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back then we were very smart herd animals. We gathered, we hunted (some), we protected ourselves, we made stone and wood tools, we understood our environment, we manipulated our environment, we communicated with each other, we cooperated and we fought, we talked, and we did the things that humans. Our standard of living? If we had to slot it into the world today, we might call it 3.25 dollars a day. Resources were not scarce, our knowledge of our East African environment was profound, and we probably had to spend a little more than one-third of our waking hours collecting 2000 calories plus essential nutrients each day, plus enough shelter and fire and clothing that we were not unduly wet or cold. We were buff: life was strenuous, especially hauling around a family in our then-seminomadic lifestyle. We were shortlived: a life expectancy at birth of perhaps 25-30: life was strenuous.\n",

    "There are things that are objective and can be measured: five bushels of properly-threshed barley kernels, or three gallons of water. There are things that are subjective that can nevertheless be accurately measured in an objective form: the feeling of heat, for example: this Northern California hot tub here in the fog feels hot, and, indeed, is at a temperature of 105F: its molecules have thermal kinetic energy above that of absolute zero by 565/180 times the difference in thermal kinetic energy between water on the edge of boiling and water on the edge of freezing. There are things that are subjective that cannot be measured: anger, rage, and sorrow. Economists start with objetively measured prices and quantities of goods and services exchanged in markets, and then go on to construct quantitative measures of subjective things like willingnesses-to-pay and willingnesses-to-substitute and values and so forth. Mid-twentieth century British economist John Maynard Keynes warned us against carrying this too far:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Approximate statistical comparisons depending on some broad element of judgment rather than of strict calculation… may possess significance and validity within certain limits. But the proper place for such things... lies within the field of historical and statistical description, and their purpose should be to satisfy historical or social curiosity... of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth—a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly vague and non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysis...\n",
    "\n",
    "Neverthless we do carry it far. For example, we have our estimates of how many people there were—100-thousand 70-thousand years ago, 3-million ten-thousand years ago—and we have our estimates of what their standard of living was on average—3.25 dollars per day. We can then make the truly heroic assumptions that underpin a more-or-less standard Solow-Malthus growth model like the one found here: <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/braddelong/LS2019/blob/master/2019-09-06-210a-ancient-intro.ipynb>. We can then construct a quantitative index $ H $ of the _value_ of the useful ideas about how to cooperate and manipulate the environment in order to provide one another with what we need, find convenient, and simply want. Set that index $ H_{-68000} $—the index of the level of human technological and organizational knowledge 70-thousand years ago, in 68-thousand BC by the common calendar—to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flash-forward 60,000 years, to 10,000 years ago, on the very eve of the invention/discovery of agriculture and of animal domestication. Things were much the same, save that there were then not one-hundred thousand of us in East Africa but rather perhaps two-and-a-half million of us, well, pretty much everywhere. Our living standards were much the same as they had been. We had better tools, but they were of stone and wood, plus fur and fiber, and not yet metal: it was still the Middle Stone Age. Our knowledge of our environment—or rather environments—was more profound, and so was our power to manipulate them. But in each environment we lived in we found ourselves in rough ecological balance. As of 8000 BC the index $ H_{-8000} $ stands at 5. \n",

    "### <font color=\"000088\"> 1.3: The Neolithic Revolution, and After </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the upward leap of the Neolithic Revolution: 2000 years after 8000 BC we are (poor) agriculturalists and (unsophisticated) herders of barely domesticated animals, with a human population of perhaps 7 million, but a lower living standard of perhaps 2.50 dollars a day, with an index $ H_{-6000} = 6.5 $. Why a near-tripling of population? Because living was easier when you were sedentary or semi-sedentary: you no longer had to carry babies substantial distances, and you could accumulate more useful stuff than you could personally carry. Plus even early agriculture and herding were very productive relative to what had come before. Since life was easier, more babies survived to grow up and themselves reproduce? Why a fall in the standard of living? Because population grew until humanity was once again in ecological balance, with population expanded to the environment's carrying capacity given technology and organization. But what keeps population from growing further? The fact that life has become harder again. But it became harder in a different way: agriculturalists are shorter, malnourished, prone to endemic diseases, and vulnerable to plagues relative to gatherer-hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes further development of agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, civilization: by year 1 the index $ H_{1} = 31 $. By year 1500 we have $ H_{1500} = 53 $. By 1500 we have 500 million humans compared to the 7 million of 6000 BC. But typical standards of living seem much the same: still 2.5 dollars a day. This is a _Malthusian Equilibrium_: vast improvements in technological and organizational capabilities, from 6.5 to 53; but all of that improvement going to support a 70-fold increase in human population; and with only 1/70 the potential natural resources at their disposal, the typical peasant or craftsman in 1500 was able to use that technology to eak out roughly the same standard of living as their predecessors 7.5 millennia before.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is definitely a spurious precision here. And even if we could gain universal assent as to technological capability in, say, ceramics and each of the other aspects of human productivity and creativity, squashing multi-dimensional objects down into a single one-dimensional index simply cannot be done. All we can say is that _if_ there were an economy simple enough for such an index to be accurate, and _if_ its levels of productivity corresponded to those we assign to the real history, _then_ its index of human technological and organizational capabilities would be our H. Nevertheless, I find such a framework very useful as a metaphor in organizing my thoughts. Queen Victoria does not appear to have been a much better queen than Queen Elizabeth. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, from all historical accounts, Gloriana appears to have been perhaps four times as happy as happy a woman as the Widow of Windsor.\n",

This time there was some increase in typical standards of living: figure a world in 1870 with 3.5 dollars a day per person, albeit much more unevently distributed. But, still, the overwhelming bulk of improvements in human technology and organization went to supporting a larger population: the 500 million of 1500 had grown to 1.3 billion by 1800, as better living standards lowered death rates worldwide.

    "\n",
    "Over the Paleolithic Era of stone and the Mesolithic Era of stone plus some pottery and textiles from 70 to 10 thousand years ago, the rate at which the stock of useful ideas about technology and organization was growing was 0.0027% per year—and, with standards of living stagnant at an average of 3.5 dollars a day or so, the rate of growth of human populations was twice that: 0.0054% per year, or 0.135% per generation: a typical generation would see, an average, 1000 people turn into 1001 and a bit more. What if growth over the generations had been much faster? Then, given the—very slow, 0.0027% per year—rate of growth in useful ideas H, the population finds itself without sufficient resources too sustain itself and drops. What if growth over the generations had been much slower? The population would find itself better-nourished, with children's immune systems less compromised and women ovulating more regularly, and population growth would have accelerated. Malthusian equilibrium thus kept population growing along with useful ideas, and the rate of growth of useful ideas was very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of growth of ideas jumped up, to 0.011% per year, during the 8000-6000 BC Neolithic Revolution: herding and agriculture were really good ideas. And progress continued at 0.013% per year from 6000-3000 BC. Agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, and more advance civilization: from 3000-1000 BC and 1000 BC-1 we see H rise at first 0.03% per year, and then 0.06% per year, with a year-1 human population of 170 million, at least half of which was collected in three great empires—Roman, Parthian, and Han—enforcing imperial peace and spanning Eurasia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from 1 to 1500 it looks like a definite not pause but slowdown in the progress of civilization and human knowledge: an ideas growth rate back to the 0.03% per year of 3000-1000 BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, last, comes the breakout:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.15% per year during the 1500-1770 Commercial Revolution.\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.44% per year during the 1770-1870 Industrial Revolution.\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 2.06% per year during the post-1870 Modern Economic Growth era.\n",
    "* a population explosion, and then a slowdown toward zero population growth as prosperity brings female education, female education brings greater female autonomy, and literate women with rights to own property find that there are other ways to gain and maintain social power than to try as hard as possible to become the mohter of many sons and daughters.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, there are two big questions in post-Neolithic Revolution global economic history:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why was there and what determined the pace of the triple accelerations in growth to 0.15% and then 0.44% and now 2.06% per year?\n",
    "2. Why was there and what determined the—much, much, much slower—pace of growth of 0.03% per year (with a 1000 BC-1 temporary jump up) from the invention of writing to 1500?\n",
    "\n",

    ">It is a commonplace that the Greeks and Romans together added little to the world's store of technical knowledge and equipment. The Neolithic and Bronze Ages between them invented or discovered, and then developed, the essential processes of agriculture, metallurgy, pottery, and textile-making. With these the Greeks and Romans built a high civilization, full of power and intellect and beauty, but they transmitted to their successors few new inventions. The gear and the screw, the rotary mill and the water-mill, the direct screw- press, glass-blowing and concrete, hollow bronze-casting, the dioptra for surveying, the torsion catapult, the water-clock and water organ, automata (mechanical toys) driven by water and wind and steam - this short list is fairly exhaustive, and it adds up to not very much for a great civilization over fifteen hundred years. Paradoxically, there was both more and less technical progress in the ancient world than the standard picture reveals. There was more, provided we avoid the mistake of hunting solely for great radical inventions and we also look at developments within the limits of the traditional techniques. There was less—far less—if we avoid the reverse mistake and look not merely for the appearance of an invention, but also for the extent of its employment...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Painted pottery is the best instance, one which takes on special significance from the fact that it is the only ancient industry whose history we can write (or will some day be able to write). The potter's wheel is a very ancient invention, and the Aegean world of the Bronze Age already knew all about the properties of clays, how to fashion a variety of pleasing shapes, how to colour and fire and produce a sheen. The heights to which the Greeks then carried this art is evident in museums all over the world. Yet these advances were all accomplished without any technical innovation, by greater mastery of the already known processes and materials, and, above all, by greater artistry. Then, in the course of the fourth century B.C., the taste for fine painted pottery disappeared, almost abruptly, and at once there was a sharp decline in quality. But people continued to need pots, and rich Greeks and Romans continued to demand better pots with some sort of decoration. Moulded decorations replaced painting and therefore a new technique was introduced in the industry, the only one in its history throughout classical antiquity. That is to say, the long-familiar technique of casting in a mould was adapted from metal to clay in order to produce commodities in the new style. Experts seem to be agreed that neither the speed nor the cost of production was significantly changed as a result. A new fashion was met by the transfer of an old technique. Fourth-century Greeks were not Neanderthal men and we need not hail this particular step as a brilliant accomplishment...\n",

    ">Granted that, the ancient world still presents us with a big question, one that is forced on us by at least two facts. The first is that the ancient world was very unambiguous about wealth. Wealth was a good thing, a necessary condition for the good life, and that was all there was to it. There was no nonsense about wealth as a trust, no subconscious guilt feelings, no death-bed restitutions of usury. The other fact, which I have already mentioned, is that, intellectually (or scientifically) speaking, there was a basis for more technical advance-in production-than was actually made. Why did productivity then not advance markedly, if the interest, the knowledge, and the necessary intellectual energy would seem to have been present? The question cannot be dismissed simply by pointing to alternative values, not, at least, when one of those was a very powerful desire for wealth and for large-scale consumption...\n",

    ">Aristotle was the greatest polymath of antiquity, a tireless researcher, and the founder of any number of new disciplines in science and philosophy.

    "\n",
    ">Vitruvius... ten books.... In the whole work I can find only one passage which considers the achievement of greater economy of effort or greater productivity. Vitruvius recommends (5.1O.1), that in public baths the hot-water room for men be placed next to the one for women, so that they can be fed from a single heat source. It will be conceded that this is not a very impressive instance. By contrast, the description of the water-mill for corn-grinding is astonishingly brief, just one short paragraph (1O.5.2), and it is absolutely bare of comment, so much so that only the reader who is so minded will appreciate the implications for effort and productivity. Vitruvius gives no hint in that direction. All in all, it is correct to say that for Vitruvius the sole aim of technical advance (apart from aesthetic considerations) is the achievement of operations which are otherwise impossible, or possible only by excessive effort.... Scattered in the prefaces there are several stories drawn from the history of inventions. Invariably the circumstance, and therefore the explanation, is either accidental (as in the discovery of the marble quarries at Ephesus when two fighting rams chipped a bit of the hillside) or frivolous (as in Archimedes' discovery of the principle of specific gravity in response to a request for a way in which to unmask a dishonest silversmith). Neither for the past nor for the present nor for the future did Vitruvius conceive of technology as something which could be advanced by sustained, systematic effort. His outlook was altogether utilitarian. Quite the reverse of Aristotle, he discussed only practical matters and referred the reader who wished to bother with 'things which are not for use but for the purposes of our delight' (Ctesibius's automata) to the available literature (1O.7.5). Yet on the matter which concerns us, Vitruvius and Aristotle were of one mind. In essence so were all the other writers on such subjects, and it is this unanimity which justifies the argument from silence.... Attitudes are the key to the blockage...\n",

    ">Impossible as it is to lump the whole of ancient society into one generalization, it would not be far wrong to say that from the Homeric world to Justinian great wealth was landed wealth, that new wealth came from war and politics (including such by-products as tax-farming), not from enterprise, and that whatever was available for investment found its way into the land as quickly as it could. There was never a time, so far as I know, when the large landholders of antiquity did not prosper as a class. Agrarian crisis was chronic among the little men, but even in the worst days of the third century, or the fifth, the magnates drew large rents and profits from their estates. In most periods they were absentee urban-dwellers, who left the management and operation of their estates either to tenants or to slaves and slave bailiffs. In either case their psychology was that of the rentier, and hence neither their material circumstances nor their attitudes were favourable to innovation. They were not so stupid or so hide-bound that they could not abandon grain production for olive and vine cultivation or pasture when circumstances pressed them, or that they could not (sometimes) tell a better landed invest-\n",

    ">In the fifth century B.C. Athens supplied much of the fine pottery for the whole Greek world and for the Etruscans, and the total production at any one time was the work of about I25 painters working with a still smaller number of shapers and assistants.... In the following century this trade died because demand disappeared, but the Athenian economy was not visibly affected, nor was its prosperity.... A few craftsmen were displaced, quality dropped sharply-that is all. The first century of the Roman Empire offers another kind of example. The fine pottery of this period was the _terra sigillata_, rather simple, well-made red ware, with moulded decorations if any. It is often called Arretine ware because at the beginning of the period the north Italian town of Arezzo monopolized production. But not for long: the Augustan peace and the consequent expansion of population and urbanization in the western provinces saw the diffusion of the manufacture of _terra sigillata_ to various centres in Gaul and along the Rhine. Arezzo was knocked out of the market and quality declined. Out of this and one or two similar developments, in the manufacture of terra cotta lamps, for example, Rostovtzeff and others following him have constructed a great theory about economic decentralization, the ruin of the bourgeoisie, the end of emergent capitalism, and the seeds of the decline of the Roman Empire. I mean no offence, but this theory is an anachronistic burlesque.... All that had happened was that a few minor trades over-reached the market, some hundreds of craftsmen in the western Empire in a few cities were displaced by some hundreds in a few other cities, and nothing else.... It reveals, first, that the minimum technology and small amounts of capital required, the wide diffusion of craft skills, and the excessive costs of transport by land, all combined to promote diffusion of manufacture when population spread away from the Mediterranean coasts; and second, that production for the domestic market and inelasticity of demand were as predominant as Xenophon believed. On the larger issue David Hume saw the picture exactly, when he wrote: 'I do not remember a passage in any ancient author, where the growth of a city is ascribed to the establishment of a manu- facture. The commerce, which is said to flourish, is chiefly the exchange of those commodities, for which different soils and climates were suited'...\n",

    ">Servile and other forms of dependent labour were very profitable. Such changes as occurred in the Roman Empire in the position of the wealthy were political, not economic, and therefore they had no significant incentive to alter the productive arrangements. In the end, it was the military and political breakdown of the Empire which drove the western aristocracy back onto their estates and to the beginnings of a manorial system. The interests of the state were another matter; from the second century on, the emperors were faced with continuing difficulties and crises in supplies and revenues. They had good reason to think of more production. That, instead, they thought of more regimentation, of a bigger bite out of the old pie, seems to me explicable largely in terms of attitudes, of thought-processes...\n",

    ">The pejorative judgments of ancient writers about labour, and specifically about the labour of the artisan, and of anyone who worksfor another, are too continuous, numerous, and unanimous, too wrapped up in discussions of every aspect of ancient life, to be dismissed as empty rhetoric.... Tocqueville['s]... notebooks... are filled with the theme that 'slavery is even more prejudicial to the masters than to the slaves', because, as a leading Louisville merchant said to him, 'it deprives us of the energy and spirit of enterprise that characterizes the States that have no slaves'. Greek and Roman slavery functioned in a different context, to be sure, both internally and externally, and comparisons must be made with caution and reserve. But this particular one seems to me to be valid and necessary...\n",

    "safety from open and secret enemies, treason and rebellion, the revolt of the slave, the overbearing of the strong, and even protection from the arm of the law; the third, wealth, is the bliss of proprietorship, mainly of heirloom or famed treasure. True, utilitarian goods, food and materials, accrue as a rule to the possessor of honor and security, but the glory outshines the goods. Poverty, on the other hand, goes with an inferior status; it involves working for one’s living, often at the bid- ding of others. The les^s restricted the bidding, the more abject the condition. Not so much manual labor—as the farmer’s ever respected position shows—but dependence upon another man’s personal whim and command causes the serving man to be despised.

    ">We must refer back to the texts.... Some of his key terms, notably kapeJike, metadosis and chrematistike, were misinterpreted in translation. Sometimes the error becomes subtle. _Kapelike_ was rendered as the art of retail trade instead of the art of \"commercial trade,” _chrematistike_ as the art of money-making instead of that of supply, i.e., the procuring of the necessaries of life in kind. In another instance, the distortion is manifest: _metadosis_ was taken to be exchange or barter, while patently meaning its opposite, namely, \"giving one's share\".... \n",
    "\n",
    ">_Kapelike_, grammatically denotes the art of the _kapelos_. The meaning of _kapelos_ as used by Herodotus in the middle of the fifth century, is broadly established as some kind of retailer, especially of food.... The invention of coined money was linked by Herodotus with the fact that the Lydians had turned _kapeloi_. Herodotus also recounts that Darius was nicknamed _kapelos_. Indeed, under him military stores may have begun the practice of retailing food. Eventually kapelos became synonymous with “trickster, fraud, cheat”.... _Kapelike_... was not in use; the dictionary mentions only one instance (apart from Aristotle).... Aristotle was using _kapelike_ with an ironical overtone. Commercial trade was of course, not huckstering; nor was it retail trading; and whatever it was, it deserved to be called some form or variant of _emporia_ which was the regular name for seafaring trade, together with any other form of large-scale or wholesale trade. When Aristotle referred specifically to the various kinds of maritime trade, he fell back on _emporia_, in the usual sense. Why, then, did he not do so in the main theoretical analysis of the subject but use instead a newfangled word of pejorative connotation? Aristotle enjoyed inventing words, and his humor, if any, was Shavian. The figure of the kapelos was an unfailing hit of the comic stage.... Commercial trade was no mystery. When all is said, it was but huckstering written large....\n",
    "\n",
    ">_Chrematistike_ was deliberately employed by Aristotle in the literal sense of providing for the necessaries of life, instead of its usual meaning of “money-making.” Laistner rendered it correctly as “the art of supply,” and Ernest Barker in his commentary recalled the original sense of _chremata_, which, he warned, was not money, but the necessaries themselves....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The signal error in rendering metadosis as \"exchange\" in the three crucial passages of the _Politics_ and the _Ethics_ cut deeper.... In an archaic society of common feasts, raiding parties, and other acts of mutual help and practical reciprocity the term _metadosis_ possessed a specific operational connotation—it signified \"giving a share\" especially to the common pool of food, whether a religious festivity, a ceremonial meal, or other public venture was in question.... Yet we are faced with the astonishing fact that in the translation of these passages in which Aristotle insisted on the derivation of exchange from _metadosis_... they rendered _metadosis_ by \"exchange,\" and thus turned Aristotle's statement into an empty truism.... his derivation of exchange from \"giving one's share\"... provided a logical link between his theory of the economy in general and the practical questions at issue. Commercial trade, we recall, he regarded as an unnatural form of trade; natural trade was gainless since it merely maintained self-sufficiency.... Thus the derivation of exchange from contributing one's share to the common pool of food was the linchpin that held together a theory of the economy based on the postulate of self-sufEciency of the community and the distinction between natural and unnatural trade...\n",

First, it may be noted that they had no reserva- tions about the desirability of wealth or about its pursuit (e.g., Finley 1985, pp. 53-57). _As long as it did not involve participation in industry or commerce_, there was nothing degrading about the wealth acquisition process. Persons of honorable status had three primary and acceptable sources of income: landholding (not infrequently as absentee landlords), \"usury,\" and what may be described as \"political payments\"...\n",

    ">The allocation of entrepreneurship between productive and unproductive activities, though by no means the only pertinent influence, can have a profound effect on the innovativeness of the economy and the degree of dissemination of its technological discoveries. It is hard to believe that a system of payoffs that moves entrepreneurship in unproductive directions is not a substantial impediment to industrial innovation and growth in productivity.... One can only note what appears to be a remarkable correlation between the degree to which an economy rewarded productive entrepreneurship and the vigor shown in that economy's innovation record. Historians tell us of several industrial \"near revolutions\"... that are highly suggestive.... Two... never went anywhere, while two of them were rather successful in their fashion.... \n",

    ">My earlier discussion cited ancient Rome and its empire as a case in which the rules did not favor productive entrepreneurship. Let us compare this with the evidence on the vigor of innovative activity in that society. The museum at Alexandria was the center of technological innovation in the Roman empire. By the first century B.C., that city knew of virtually every form of machine gearing that is used today, including a working steam engine.

But perhaps the supreme inhibiting factor was the overwhelming prestige of the state bureaucracy, which maimed from the start any attempt of the bourgeoisie to be different, to become aware of themselves as a class and fight for an autonomous position in society. Free enterprise, ready and proud to take risks, is therefore quite exceptional and abnormal in Chinese economic history....\n",
