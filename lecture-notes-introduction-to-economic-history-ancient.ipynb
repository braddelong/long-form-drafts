    "70,000 years ago, back in the old stone age, there were perhaps 100,000 of *us*—100,000 east African plains apes who looked like us, moved like us, acted like us, talked like us, and from whom the overwhelming proportion of all of our heredity is derived. Yes, we have small admixtures (5%?) from other groups and subspecies and may be even species, but overwhelmingly we are those proto-hundred-thousand's children, and we are all all of their children: it is overwhelmingly likely that each of those who still has living descendants today has a place—has an astronomical number of places—on our <http://ancestry.com> family tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back then we were very smart herd animals. We gathered, we hunted (some), we protected ourselves, we made stone and wood tools, we understood our environment, we manipulated our environment, we communicated with each other, we cooperated and we fought, we talked, and we did the things that humans. Our standard of living? If we had to slot it into emerging-markets standards of living in the world today, we might call it 3.25 dollars a day. Poverty, but not what the United Nations calls extreme poverty: natural resources were not scarce, our knowledge of our east African environment was profound, and we probably had to spend a little more than one-third of our waking hours collecting 2000 calories plus essential nutrients each day, plus enough shelter and fire and clothing that we were not unduly wet or cold. We were buff: life was strenuous. We were shortlived: a life expectancy at birth of perhaps 25-30, for hauling around a family in our then-seminomadic lifestyle was dangerous: life was strenuous.\n",

    "There are things that are objective and can be measured: five bushels of properly-threshed barley kernels, or three gallons of water. There are things that are subjective that can nevertheless be accurately measured in an objective form: the feeling of heat, for example: this northern California hot tub here in the fog feels hot, and, indeed, is at a temperature of 105F: its molecules have thermal kinetic energy above that of absolute zero by 565/180 times the difference in thermal kinetic energy between water on the edge of boiling and water on the edge of freezing. There are things that are subjective that cannot be measured: anger, rage, and sorrow. Economists start with objetively measured prices and quantities of goods and services exchanged in markets, and then go on to construct quantitative measures of subjective things like willingnesses-to-pay and willingnesses-to-substitute and values and so forth. Mid-twentieth century British economist John Maynard Keynes warned us against carrying this too far:\n",

But the proper place for such things... lies within the field of historical and statistical description, and their purpose should be to satisfy historical or social curiosity... of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth—a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly vague and non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysis...\n",

    "Neverthless we do carry it far. For example, we have our estimates of how many people there were—100-thousand 70-thousand years ago, 3-million ten-thousand years ago—and we have our estimates of what their standard of living was on average—3.25 dollars per day. We can then make the truly heroic assumptions that underpin a more-or-less standard Solow-Malthus growth model like the one found here: <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/braddelong/LS2019/blob/master/2019-09-06-210a-ancient-intro.ipynb>. We can then construct a quantitative index $ H $ of the _value_ of the useful ideas about how to cooperate and manipulate the environment in order to provide one another with what we need, find convenient, and simply want. Set that index $ H_{-68000} $—the index of the level of human technological and organizational knowledge 70-thousand years ago, in 68-thousand BC by the common calendar—to 1. \n",

Things were much the same, save that there were then not one-hundred thousand of us in East Africa but rather perhaps two-and-a-half million of us, well, pretty much everywhere. Our living standards were much the same as they had been. We had better tools, but they were of stone and wood, plus fur and fiber, and not yet metal: it was still the Middle Stone Age. Our knowledge of our environment—or rather environments—was more profound, and so was our power to manipulate them. But in each environment we lived in we found ourselves in rough ecological balance.

    "Then, at the end of the gatherer-hunter age, comes the upward leap (or was it an upward leap) of the neolithic—new stone¸—revolution: 2000 years after 8000 BC we are (poor) agriculturalists and (unsophisticated) herders of barely domesticated animals, with a human population of perhaps 7 million, but a lower living standard of perhaps 2.50 dollars a day, with an index $ H_{-6000} = 6.5 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why a near-tripling of population? Because living was easier when you were sedentary or semi-sedentary: you no longer had to carry babies substantial distances, and you could accumulate more useful stuff than you could personally carry. Plus even early agriculture and herding were very productive relative to what had come before. Since life was easier, more babies survived to grow up and themselves reproduce? \n",
    "\n",
    "Why a fall in the standard of living? Because population grew until humanity was once again in ecological balance, with population expanded to the environment's carrying capacity given technology and organization. But what keeps population from growing further? The fact that life has become harder again. But it became harder in a different way: agriculturalists are shorter—figure about three inches, 7.5 centimeters—malnourished, prone to endemic diseases, and vulnerable to plagues relative to gatherer-hunters. Biologically, it would seem much better to be a typical person in the gatherer-hunter than in the neolithic age: your life expectancy is no less, your daily life presents you with more interesting and less boring cognitive problems, and you are much more buff and swole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jared Diamond believes—or at least whoever wrote the title of his article believes—that the invention of agriculture was, as the title says, a bad mistaker: humans would be better-off had we remained gatherer-hunters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes further development of agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, civilization: by year 1 the index $ H_{1} = 31 $. By year 1500 we have $ H_{1500} = 53 $. By 1500 we have 500 million humans compared to the 7 million of 6000 BC. But typical standards of living seem much the same: still 2.5 dollars a day. This is a _Malthusian Equilibrium_: vast improvements in technological and organizational capabilities, from 6.5 to 53; but all of that improvement going to support a 70-fold increase in human population; and with only 1/70 the potential natural resources at their disposal, the typical peasant or craftsman in 1500 was able to use that technology to eak out roughly the same standard of living as their predecessors 7.5 millennia before.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is definitely a spurious precision here. And even if we could gain universal assent as to technological capability in, say, ceramics and each of the other aspects of human productivity and creativity, squashing multi-dimensional objects down into a single one-dimensional index simply cannot be done. All we can say is that _if_ there were an economy simple enough for such an index to be accurate, and _if_ its levels of productivity corresponded to those we assign to the real history, _then_ its index of human technological and organizational capabilities would be our H. Nevertheless, I find such a framework very useful as a metaphor in organizing my thoughts. \n",

    "Then comes a speedup: from 1500 to 1770 to 1870—over, first, the Commercial Revolution and, second, the Industrial Revolution eras—our quantitative index H grows from 53 to 79 to 125. This time there was some increase in typical standards of living: figure a world in 1870 with 3.5 dollars a day per person, albeit much more unevently distributed. But, still, the overwhelming bulk of improvements in human technology and organization went to supporting a larger population: the 500 million of 1500 had grown to 1.3 billion by 1800, as better living standards lowered death rates worldwide. (And you can dive deeper into the _Commercial Revolution_ <> and the _Industrial Revolution_ <>.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came the explosion: from 1870 to today, in our era of Modern Economic Growth, our H has risen from 125 to 2720. Our population has risen from 1.3 to 7.6 billion. And our resources from 3.5 to 32 dollars a day. (And you can dive deeper into _Modern Economic Growth_: <>.)\n",

    "### <font color=\"000088\"> 1.5: Rates of Growth </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the Paleolithic Era of stone and the Mesolithic Era of stone plus some pottery and textiles from 70 to 10 thousand years ago, the rate at which the stock of useful ideas about technology and organization was growing was 0.0027% per year—and, with standards of living stagnant at an average of 3.5 dollars a day or so, the rate of growth of human populations was twice that: 0.0054% per year, or 0.135% per generation: a typical generation would see, an average, 1000 people turn into 1001 and a bit more. What if growth over the generations had been much faster? Then, given the—very slow, 0.0027% per year—rate of growth in useful ideas H, the population finds itself without sufficient resources too sustain itself and drops. What if growth over the generations had been much slower? The population would find itself better-nourished, with children's immune systems less compromised and women ovulating more regularly, and population growth would have accelerated. Malthusian equilibrium thus kept population growing along with useful ideas, and the rate of growth of useful ideas was very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of growth of ideas jumped up, to 0.011% per year, during the 8000-6000 BC Neolithic Revolution: herding and agriculture were really good ideas. And progress continued at 0.013% per year from 6000-3000 BC. Agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, and more advance civilization: from 3000-1000 BC and 1000 BC-1 we see H rise at first 0.03% per year, and then 0.06% per year, with a year-1 human population of 170 million, at least half of which was collected in three great empires—Roman, Parthian, and Han—enforcing imperial peace and spanning Eurasia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from 1 to 1500 it looks like a definite not pause but slowdown in the progress of civilization and human knowledge: an ideas growth rate back to the 0.03% per year of 3000-1000 BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, last, comes the breakout:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.15% per year during the 1500-1770 Commercial Revolution.\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.44% per year during the 1770-1870 Industrial Revolution.\n",
    "* a growth rate of useful ideas of 2.06% per year during the post-1870 Modern Economic Growth era.\n",
    "* a population explosion, and then a slowdown toward zero population growth as prosperity brings female education, female education brings greater female autonomy, and literate women with rights to own property find that there are other ways to gain and maintain social power than to try as hard as possible to become the mohter of many sons and daughters.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, there are two big questions in post-Neolithic Revolution global economic history:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why was there and what determined the pace of the triple accelerations in growth to 0.15% and then 0.44% and now 2.06% per year?\n",
    "2. Why was there and what determined the—much, much, much slower—pace of growth of 0.03% per year (with a 1000 BC-1 temporary jump up) from the invention of writing to 1500?\n",

    "2. the ratio between the savings-investment rate $ s $ and the depreciation rate $ \\delta $, raised to the parameter $ \\theta $ which governs how much an increase in the capital-output ratio raises income—with a higher $ \\theta $ the rule of law, imperial peace, and a culture of thrift and invetment matter more, and can generate \"efflorescences\"—times\n",
    "\n",
    "3. one over the conveniences-and-luxuries parameter $ \\phi $—it drives a wedge between prosperity and subsistence as spending is diverted categories that do not affect reproduction, such as middle-class luxuries, upper-class luxuries, but also the \"luxury\" of having an upper class, and the additional conveniences of living in cities and having trade networks that can spread plagues—times\n",
    "\n",
    "4. two nuisance terms near zero, which depend on how much the level of population must fall below the true subsistence level at which population growth averages zero to generate the (small) average population growth rate that produces growing resource scarcity that offsets the (small) rate of growth of useful ideas. all this\n",

We have 50 times as many people alive today as were alive then, and we can and do communicate and broadcast ideas much faster and wider.

It is only after 1500 and the coming of the Commercial Revolution era that, globally, two heads seem genuinely better than one over time, and the average pace of idea-stock growth accelerates to nearly 4% per generation, and then to 16% per generation, and now to 67% per generation.\n",

The gear and the screw, the rotary mill and the water-mill, the direct screw- press, glass-blowing and concrete, hollow bronze-casting, the dioptra for surveying, the torsion catapult, the water-clock and water organ, automata (mechanical toys) driven by water and wind and steam-this short list is fairly exhaustive, and it adds up to not very much for a great civilization over fifteen hundred years...\n",
    "\n",
    ">...Paradoxically, there was both more and less technical progress in the ancient world than the standard picture reveals. There was more, provided we avoid the mistake of hunting solely for great radical inventions and we also look at developments within the limits of the traditional techniques. There was less—far less—if we avoid the reverse mistake and look not merely for the appearance of an invention, but also for the extent of its employment.... Painted pottery is the best instance, one which takes on special significance from the fact that it is the only ancient industry whose history we can write (or will some day be able to write). The potter's wheel is a very ancient invention, and the Aegean world of the Bronze Age already knew all about the properties of clays, how to fashion a variety of pleasing shapes, how to colour and fire and produce a sheen. The heights to which the Greeks then carried this art is evident in museums all over the world. Yet these advances were all accomplished without any technical innovation, by greater mastery of the already known processes and materials, and, above all, by greater artistry. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Then, in the course of the fourth century B.C., the taste for fine painted pottery disappeared, almost abruptly, and at once there was a sharp decline in quality. But people continued to need pots, and rich Greeks and Romans continued to demand better pots with some sort of decoration. Moulded decorations replaced painting and therefore a new technique was introduced in the industry, the only one in its history throughout classical antiquity. That is to say, the long-familiar technique of casting in a mould was adapted from metal to clay in order to produce commodities in the new style. Experts seem to be agreed that neither the speed nor the cost of production was significantly changed as a result. A new fashion was met by the transfer of an old technique. Fourth-century Greeks were not Neanderthal men and we need not hail this particular step as a brilliant accomplishment...\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear to me that Moses Finley's distinction between \"technical innovation\" and \"greater mastery... and... greater artistry\" can be maintained:\n",

At the risk of grossly simplifying matters we can put them into three bins: First... that market expansion is sufficient for sustained economic growth.... They will be inclined to favorably quote Adam Smith from his lectures on jurisprudence that 'Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice'.... Second... that colonial empires or natural resources like coal were crucial for modern economic growth.... Third... that ultimately only innovation can explain the transition to modern economic growth. This is the position of the majority of economic historians.... The idea that simple economics could explain why innovators developed labor-saving machinery like the spinning jenny in 18th century England (but not in France or India) is advanced by Bob Allen.... Two prominent alternative versions of 3b are associated with Deirdre McCloskey and Joel Mokyr... both would agree that the inventive and enterprising spirit that characterized 18th century England cannot be explained in terms of simple incentives. They instead argue that it required recognition of 'Bourgeois Dignity' or a 'Culture of Growth'...\n",

    "\n",
    ">...I wish to argue that this attack has not gone far enough.... It was been widely recognized that well before the Industrial and French revolutions, European societies and economies departed from the ideal-typical view of \"feudal\" economically and technologically stagnant agrarian societies dominated by a predatory elite that wasted all surpluses. Rather... from at least the twelfth century onward... a trans-European set of urban networks that combined management of urban and rural market-oriented craft production... with a flourishing intra-European and extra-European global trade; and from at least the sixteenth century national rulers brought their unruly agrarian elites to heel bybuilding bureaucratized central (\"absolutist\") governments that provided a rule of law and framework for the protection and  accumulation of private property and capital... many of the characterisics of 'modern' growth, or of 'modern' political and social structures, in gestation.... \n",
    "\n",
    ">Every one of the above trends observed in Europe and labeled as proof of 'early modern' character—technical improvements in agriculture and production providing rising total output and per capital productivity (including  aggressive transformation of the natural landscape); vast urban-based  regional and global trade networks supporting wealthy merchant classes; and increasingly centralized and bureaucratized political regimes thatcreated ordered territories and subordinated elites—are also widely evident outside of Europe prior to the eighteenth century... often earlier and in a higher state of development....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Let me propose... 'efflorescence,\" intended as the opposite of 'crisis'. Where a crisis is a relatively sharp, unexpected downturn in significant demographic and economic indices, often accompanied by political turmoil and cultural conflicts, an 'efflorescence' is a relatively sharp, often unexpected upturn... usually accompanied by political expansion and institution building and cultural synthesis and consoliidation.. involv[ing] both Smithian and Schumpeterian growth... often seen by contemporaries or successors as 'golden ages'... often set[ting] new patterns for thought, political organization, and economic life that last for many generations.... Throughout history, all societies have experienced periods of efflorescence, as well as extensive growth, stagnation, and crises—but that these processes are all distinct from Kuznetzian 'modern' economic growth founded on the continual and conscious application of scientific and technological progress to economic activity...\n",

    "**Ian Morris**: _Economic Growth in Ancient Greece_ <https://delong.typepad.com/morris-greece.pdf>: \"The first complex societies emerged in Mesopotamia (what is now southern Iraq), Egypt, the Indus Valley (in what is now Pakistan), and China around 3500 BC. Their rulers claimed special relationships with the gods, and organized at least some sectors of the economy through redistribution. Palace- or temple- bureaucracies oversaw certain kinds of production, bringing goods in and redistributing them as rations to different kinds of workers...\n",

    ">...Similar palaces... appearing on Crete around 2000 BC, and in Greece by 1600. The palatial elites shared a sophisticated international culture, linked by letters, gift exchange, and dynastic marriages. Finds of Greek artifacts in eastern Sicily, southern Italy, and Sardinia from 1400 on suggest that the system was still expanding at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Around 1200, though, most of the great palaces... were set on fire.... Migrations and earthquakes were involved. Egypt and southern Iraq escaped the destructions, but... suffered demographic decline and a weakening of state authority. Egypt fared best, and Greece worst. In Greece, palaces disappeared after 1200, and with them writing and many advanced artistic skills.... Greece was depopulated, with simple societies living at a low technological level. This changed rapidly in the eighth century, as all across the Mediterranean, trade revived, and competition between communities stimulated the formation of small city-states. Learning from the Phoenecians, thousands of Greeks colonized the coasts of Sicily and southern Italy. Greeks invented a new style of writing around 775-750 BC, and used it to record Homer's epic poetry. Monumental architecture revived, and representational art. The Greek city-states developed peculiar forms of male civic e based on the idea that all locally born free men were more or less city-states, this developed by 500 into democratic institutions, in which all male citizens... voted equally on all major decisions. Elsewhere more limited groups of men (usually defined by wealth) made the key decisions, but were answerable to the larger community.\n",

    ">Sparta, Athens, and Syracuse emerged as the most powerful city states early in the sixth century. In 480 Sparta and Athens led an alliance that repulsed from the Persian Empire, and in the same year Syracuse defeateda Carthaginian invasion of Sicily.... Athens and Syracuse then went on, in very different ways, to build up powerful states in the fifth century. Both populations of 40,000-50,000. This period also saw a dramatic cultural flourescence.... By the 430s it looked as if Athens might convert the Aegean into a unified state... so in 431 Sparta went to war.... This Peloponnesian War... ended when Sparta secured Persian funding, built a great navy, and starved Athens inot submission. Sparta then took over Athens's empire, but failed to hold it together, while in Sicily Syracuse, after repulsing an Athenian attack in 415-13, was badly battered by Carthage after 409....\n",

    ">Macedonian kings adopted Greek military and organizational skills... [and] by 338 he had humbled the main Greek powers.... Alexander... in 331 killed the Persian king. He spent the next eight years subduing the empire. By the time Alexander died in 323, the old city-state... were losing their relevance. Hundreds of thousands of Greeks... settled in the newly conquered Middle East, particularly in Egypt, coastal Syria, and  what is now Turkey. The greatest Greek city, Alexandria in Egypt, grew to 500,000 people, dwarfing anything in the old Greek world, and several cities in Iraq reached 100,000 in the third century. Alexander's generals fought over his empire for a quarter-century... dividing it into three major kingdoms in Egypt, the Near East, and Macedon....\n",

    "\n",
    ">There is admittedly a danger, in pursuing this line of argument, of falling into the trap of assuming that certain values are always and necessarily paramount. The idea that efficiency, increased productivity, economic rationalism and growth are good per se is very recent in human thinking (although it seems to take hold in a most remarkable way once it gets an effective start). We might consider the Pont du Gard a fantastically expensive way of bringing fresh water to a not very important provincial town in southern Gaul; the Romans in Gaul ranked fresh water and the demonstration of power higher on the value-scale than costs. That was a rational view, too, though not economic rationalism...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Granted that, the ancient world still presents us with a big question, one that is forced on us by at least two facts. The first is that the ancient world was very unambiguous about wealth. Wealth was a good thing, a necessary condition for the good life, and that was all there was to it. There was no nonsense about wealth as a trust, no subconscious guilt feelings, no death-bed restitutions of usury. The other fact, which I have already mentioned, is that, intellectually (or scientifically) speaking, there was a basis for more technical advance-in production-than was actually made. Why did productivity then not advance markedly, if the interest, the knowledge, and the necessary intellectual energy would seem to have been present? The question cannot be dismissed simply by pointing to alternative values, not, at least, when one of those was a very powerful desire for wealth and for large-scale consumption...\n",
    "\n",
    ">At the end of the first section of the _Politics_ (I 258b 33ff.), [Aristotle] wrote as follows (in Barker's translation):\n",
    "\n",
    ">>A general account has now been given of the various forms of acquisition: to consider them minutely, and in detail, might be useful for practical purposes; but to dwell long upon them would be in poor taste.... There are books on these subjects by several writers.... Anyone who is interested should study these subjects with the aid of these writings...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Aristotle was the greatest polymath of antiquity, a tireless researcher, and the founder of any number of new disciplines in science and philosophy. His curiosity was unbounded, but 'good taste', a moral category, interposed to put beyond the pale knowledge in its practical applications except when the application was ethical or political...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Vitruvius... ten books.... In the whole work I can find only one passage which considers the achievement of greater economy of effort or greater productivity. Vitruvius recommends (5.1O.1), that in public baths the hot-water room for men be placed next to the one for women, so that they can be fed from a single heat source. It will be conceded that this is not a very impressive instance. By contrast, the description of the water-mill for corn-grinding is astonishingly brief, just one short paragraph (1O.5.2), and it is absolutely bare of comment, so much so that only the reader who is so minded will appreciate the implications for effort and productivity. Vitruvius gives no hint in that direction. All in all, it is correct to say that for Vitruvius the sole aim of technical advance (apart from aesthetic considerations) is the achievement of operations which are otherwise impossible, or possible only by excessive effort.... Scattered in the prefaces there are several stories drawn from the history of inventions. Invariably the circumstance, and therefore the explanation, is either accidental (as in the discovery of the marble quarries at Ephesus when two fighting rams chipped a bit of the hillside) or frivolous (as in Archimedes' discovery of the principle of specific gravity in response to a request for a way in which to unmask a dishonest silversmith). Neither for the past nor for the present nor for the future did Vitruvius conceive of technology as something which could be advanced by sustained, systematic effort. His outlook was altogether utilitarian. Quite the reverse of Aristotle, he discussed only practical matters and referred the reader who wished to bother with 'things which are not for use but for the purposes of our delight' (Ctesibius's automata) to the available literature (1O.7.5). Yet on the matter which concerns us, Vitruvius and Aristotle were of one mind. In essence so were all the other writers on such subjects, and it is this unanimity which justifies the argument from silence.... Attitudes are the key to the blockage...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Impossible as it is to lump the whole of ancient society into one generalization, it would not be far wrong to say that from the Homeric world to Justinian great wealth was landed wealth, that new wealth came from war and politics (including such by-products as tax-farming), not from enterprise, and that whatever was available for investment found its way into the land as quickly as it could. There was never a time, so far as I know, when the large landholders of antiquity did not prosper as a class. Agrarian crisis was chronic among the little men, but even in the worst days of the third century, or the fifth, the magnates drew large rents and profits from their estates. In most periods they were absentee urban-dwellers, who left the management and operation of their estates either to tenants or to slaves and slave bailiffs. In either case their psychology was that of the rentier, and hence neither their material circumstances nor their attitudes were favourable to innovation. They were not so stupid or so hide-bound that they could not abandon grain production for olive and vine cultivation or pasture when circumstances pressed them, or that they could not (sometimes) tell a better landed invest-\n",
    "ment from a poorer one. But essentially their energies went into spending their wealth, not making it, and they spent it on politics and the good life...\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the fifth century B.C. Athens supplied much of the fine pottery for the whole Greek world and for the Etruscans, and the total production at any one time was the work of about I25 painters working with a still smaller number of shapers and assistants.... In the following century this trade died because demand disappeared, but the Athenian economy was not visibly affected, nor was its prosperity.... A few craftsmen were displaced, quality dropped sharply-that is all. The first century of the Roman Empire offers another kind of example. The fine pottery of this period was the _terra sigillata_, rather simple, well-made red ware, with moulded decorations if any. It is often called Arretine ware because at the beginning of the period the north Italian town of Arezzo monopolized production. But not for long: the Augustan peace and the consequent expansion of population and urbanization in the western provinces saw the diffusion of the manufacture of _terra sigillata_ to various centres in Gaul and along the Rhine. Arezzo was knocked out of the market and quality declined. Out of this and one or two similar developments, in the manufacture of terra cotta lamps, for example, Rostovtzeff and others following him have constructed a great theory about economic decentralization, the ruin of the bourgeoisie, the end of emergent capitalism, and the seeds of the decline of the Roman Empire. I mean no offence, but this theory is an anachronistic burlesque.... All that had happened was that a few minor trades over-reached the market, some hundreds of craftsmen in the western Empire in a few cities were displaced by some hundreds in a few other cities, and nothing else.... It reveals, first, that the minimum technology and small amounts of capital required, the wide diffusion of craft skills, and the excessive costs of transport by land, all combined to promote diffusion of manufacture when population spread away from the Mediterranean coasts; and second, that production for the domestic market and inelasticity of demand were as predominant as Xenophon believed. On the larger issue David Hume saw the picture exactly, when he wrote: 'I do not remember a passage in any ancient author, where the growth of a city is ascribed to the establishment of a manu- facture. The commerce, which is said to flourish, is chiefly the exchange of those commodities, for which different soils and climates were suited'...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Servile and other forms of dependent labour were very profitable. Such changes as occurred in the Roman Empire in the position of the wealthy were political, not economic, and therefore they had no significant incentive to alter the productive arrangements. In the end, it was the military and political breakdown of the Empire which drove the western aristocracy back onto their estates and to the beginnings of a manorial system. The interests of the state were another matter; from the second century on, the emperors were faced with continuing difficulties and crises in supplies and revenues. They had good reason to think of more production. That, instead, they thought of more regimentation, of a bigger bite out of the old pie, seems to me explicable largely in terms of attitudes, of thought-processes...\n",
    "\n",
    ">The pejorative judgments of ancient writers about labour, and specifically about the labour of the artisan, and of anyone who worksfor another, are too continuous, numerous, and unanimous, too wrapped up in discussions of every aspect of ancient life, to be dismissed as empty rhetoric.... Tocqueville['s]... notebooks... are filled with the theme that 'slavery is even more prejudicial to the masters than to the slaves', because, as a leading Louisville merchant said to him, 'it deprives us of the energy and spirit of enterprise that characterizes the States that have no slaves'. Greek and Roman slavery functioned in a different context, to be sure, both internally and externally, and comparisons must be made with caution and reserve. But this particular one seems to me to be valid and necessary...\n",

    ">In the philosophy of Aristotle the three prizes of fortune were: honor and prestige; security of life and limb; wealth. The first stands for privilege and homage, rank and precedence; the second ensures\n",
    "safety from open and secret enemies, treason and rebellion, the revolt of the slave, the overbearing of the strong, and even protection from the arm of the law; the third, wealth, is the bliss of proprietorship, mainly of heirloom or famed treasure. True, utilitarian goods, food and materials, accrue as a rule to the possessor of honor and security, but the glory outshines the goods. Poverty, on the other hand, goes with an inferior status; it involves working for one’s living, often at the bid- ding of others. The les^s restricted the bidding, the more abject the condition. Not so much manual labor—as the farmer’s ever respected position shows—but dependence upon another man’s personal whim and command causes the serving man to be despised. Again, the bare economic fact of a lower income is screened from view...\n",
    "\n",
    ">We must refer back to the texts.... Some of his key terms, notably kapeJike, metadosis and chrematistike, were misinterpreted in translation. Sometimes the error becomes subtle. _Kapelike_ was rendered as the art of retail trade instead of the art of \"commercial trade,” _chrematistike_ as the art of money-making instead of that of supply, i.e., the procuring of the necessaries of life in kind. In another instance, the distortion is manifest: _metadosis_ was taken to be exchange or barter, while patently meaning its opposite, namely, \"giving one's share\".... \n",
    "\n",
    ">_Kapelike_, grammatically denotes the art of the _kapelos_. The meaning of _kapelos_ as used by Herodotus in the middle of the fifth century, is broadly established as some kind of retailer, especially of food.... The invention of coined money was linked by Herodotus with the fact that the Lydians had turned _kapeloi_. Herodotus also recounts that Darius was nicknamed _kapelos_. Indeed, under him military stores may have begun the practice of retailing food. Eventually kapelos became synonymous with “trickster, fraud, cheat”.... _Kapelike_... was not in use; the dictionary mentions only one instance (apart from Aristotle).... Aristotle was using _kapelike_ with an ironical overtone. Commercial trade was of course, not huckstering; nor was it retail trading; and whatever it was, it deserved to be called some form or variant of _emporia_ which was the regular name for seafaring trade, together with any other form of large-scale or wholesale trade. When Aristotle referred specifically to the various kinds of maritime trade, he fell back on _emporia_, in the usual sense. Why, then, did he not do so in the main theoretical analysis of the subject but use instead a newfangled word of pejorative connotation? Aristotle enjoyed inventing words, and his humor, if any, was Shavian. The figure of the kapelos was an unfailing hit of the comic stage.... Commercial trade was no mystery. When all is said, it was but huckstering written large....\n",
    "\n",
    ">_Chrematistike_ was deliberately employed by Aristotle in the literal sense of providing for the necessaries of life, instead of its usual meaning of “money-making.” Laistner rendered it correctly as “the art of supply,” and Ernest Barker in his commentary recalled the original sense of _chremata_, which, he warned, was not money, but the necessaries themselves....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The signal error in rendering metadosis as \"exchange\" in the three crucial passages of the _Politics_ and the _Ethics_ cut deeper.... In an archaic society of common feasts, raiding parties, and other acts of mutual help and practical reciprocity the term _metadosis_ possessed a specific operational connotation—it signified \"giving a share\" especially to the common pool of food, whether a religious festivity, a ceremonial meal, or other public venture was in question.... Yet we are faced with the astonishing fact that in the translation of these passages in which Aristotle insisted on the derivation of exchange from _metadosis_... they rendered _metadosis_ by \"exchange,\" and thus turned Aristotle's statement into an empty truism.... his derivation of exchange from \"giving one's share\"... provided a logical link between his theory of the economy in general and the practical questions at issue. Commercial trade, we recall, he regarded as an unnatural form of trade; natural trade was gainless since it merely maintained self-sufficiency.... Thus the derivation of exchange from contributing one's share to the common pool of food was the linchpin that held together a theory of the economy based on the postulate of self-sufEciency of the community and the distinction between natural and unnatural trade...\n",

    "\n",
    ">The avenues open to those Romans who sought power, prestige, and wealth are instructive. First, it may be noted that they had no reserva- tions about the desirability of wealth or about its pursuit (e.g., Finley 1985, pp. 53-57). _As long as it did not involve participation in industry or commerce_, there was nothing degrading about the wealth acquisition process. Persons of honorable status had three primary and acceptable sources of income: landholding (not infrequently as absentee landlords), \"usury,\" and what may be described as \"political payments\"...\n",
    "\n",
    ">The allocation of entrepreneurship between productive and unproductive activities, though by no means the only pertinent influence, can have a profound effect on the innovativeness of the economy and the degree of dissemination of its technological discoveries. It is hard to believe that a system of payoffs that moves entrepreneurship in unproductive directions is not a substantial impediment to industrial innovation and growth in productivity.... One can only note what appears to be a remarkable correlation between the degree to which an economy rewarded productive entrepreneurship and the vigor shown in that economy's innovation record. Historians tell us of several industrial \"near revolutions\"... that are highly suggestive.... Two... never went anywhere, while two of them were rather successful in their fashion.... \n",
    "\n",
    ">My earlier discussion cited ancient Rome and its empire as a case in which the rules did not favor productive entrepreneurship. Let us compare this with the evidence on the vigor of innovative activity in that society. The museum at Alexandria was the center of technological innovation in the Roman empire. By the first century B.C., that city knew of virtually every form of machine gearing that is used today, including a working steam engine. But these seem to have been used only to make what amounted to elaborate toys. The steam engine was used only to open and close the doors of a temple....\n",

    ">The spate of inventions that occurred in ancient China (before it was conquered by the barbarian Yuan dynasty in 1280)... paper, (perhaps) the compass, waterwheels, sophisticated water clocks, and, of course, gunpowder.... In China too, as we have seen, the rules did not favor productive entrepreneurship. Balazs (1964, p. 53) concludes that\n",
    "\n",
    ">>what was chiefly lacking... was not mechanical skill or scientific a titude, nor a sufficient accumulation of wealth, but scope for individual enterprise. There was no individual freedom and no security for private enterprise, no legal foundation for rights other than those of the state, no alternative investment other than landed property, no guarantee against being penalized by arbitrary exactions from officials or against intervention by the state. But perhaps the supreme inhibiting factor was the overwhelming prestige of the state bureaucracy, which maimed from the start any attempt of the bourgeoisie to be different, to become aware of themselves as a class and fight for an autonomous position in society. Free enterprise, ready and proud to take risks, is therefore quite exceptional and abnormal in Chinese economic history....\n",

    ">By the beginning of the fourteenth century, according to Gimpel (1976), 68 mills were in operation on less than one mile of the banks of the Seine in Paris, and these were supplemented by floating mills anchored to the Grand Pont. The activity in metallurgy was also considerable-sufficient to denude much of Europe of its forests and to produce a rise in the price of wood that forced recourse to coal (Nef [1934].... The industrial revolution of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was a surprisingly robust affair, and it is surely plausible that improved rewards to industrial activity had something to do with its vigor. The end of all this period of buoyant activity in the fourteenth century... has a variety of explanations, many of them having no connection with entrepreneurship. For one thing... average temperatures dropped.... The plague returned.... The church clamped down on new ideas and other manifestations of freedom. Roger Bacon himself was put under constraint. The period during which new ways of thinking brought rewards and status was apparently ended.... The first half of the devastating Hundred Years' War... the associated renewal of rewards to military enterprise....\n",

The fragments in his _Ethics_ and _Politics_ that economists like Joseph Schumpeter point to are, mostly, concerned with other things than economic analysis.

Property is a part of the household... no man can live well, or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries.... [T]he workers must have their own proper instruments... of various sorts; some are living, others lifeless; in the rudder, the pilot of a ship has a lifeless, in the look-out man, a living instrument.... [I]f every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves.... But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition is expedient and right?... There is no difficulty in answering this question... that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule...\"\n",

    "* The “natural art of acquisition” has “a boundary fixed, just as there is in the other arts; for the instruments of any art are never unlimited...”\n",
    "* “There are two sorts of wealth-getting... one is a part of household management, the other is retail trade: the former necessary and honorable, while that which consists in exchange is justly censured; for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another…”\n",

    "* “It is this unanimity which justifies the argument from silence…”\n",
    "* “Why did neither the Ptolemies nor the Sicilian tyrants nor the Roman emperors systematically (or even spasmodically) turn their engineers to the search for higher productivity, at least in those sectors of the economy which produced the royal revenues? Whatever the answer, it was not lack of capital (or lack of authority). Funds, manpower and technical skills were made available (and wasted) in vast and ever increasing amounts for roads, public buildings, water supply, drainage and other amenities, but not for production. Of course, the effort to increase productivity might have proved unsuccessful - but it was never even attempted…”\n",
    "* “It is unnecessary to examine the economic history of the later Roman Empire in detail to make the point, with which no one disagrees, that neither technique nor productivity nor economic rationalism made an advance in those final centuries of antiquity. It is, necessary, however, to ask once more why, when circumstances seemed to demand progress on those lines, the only solutions to the problems of labour and production were bureaucratic pressures, greater tax exploitation, and a general debasement of the status (and perhaps the standards) of the free elements in the productive population. The answers, I suggest, are those I pointed to earlier. Servile and other forms of dependent labour were very profitable. Such changes as occurred in the Roman Empire in the position of the wealthy were political, not economic, and therefore they had no significant incentive to alter the productive arrangements. In the end, it was the military and political breakdown of the Empire which drove the western aristocracy back onto their estates and to the beginnings of a manorial system…”\n",
    "* Finley says “culture”. But there are other possibilities:\n",
    "    * 7 billion heads are better than 5 million…\n",
    "    * Standing on the shoulders of giants…\n",
    "    * Incentives to innovate rather than plunder (William Gates vs. William Marshall)…\n",
