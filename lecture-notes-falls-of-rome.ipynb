They were interlinked: the Roman Peace was a substantial part of Roman-Era prosperity. And the resources of the civilization could be harvested for purposes of the empire. But they were not the same.\n",

    "    3. urbanization and trade—perhaps most important, both in boosting the effective savings-investment rate via public goods and a finer and more productive division of labor, and also imposing a very heavy bad public health-generated disease burden on the population: consuption of goods and sevices and the comforts of live go up, but mortality and morbidity go up too, and stature goes down.\n",

With the growth of its Empire, with the growth of its cities, and with the growth of a system of government and transportation based on those cities, Rome had created the perhaps most prosperous and successful pre-industrial  economy in history. The age of Antoninus Pius was indeed probably the best age to live in pre-industrial history...\n",

Goldsworthy further says that after 200 emperors thought that if they kept senators from army command then they wouldn't have to worry about frontier generals making a bid for power—for who in Rome would agree to be ruled by some upstart whose ancestors had never been a senator?

    "\n",
    "Such leaders turned out to have a big advantage in the fifth century as they combined two sources of power. And in the end some of them decided that they would rather try to be secure as barbarian king of a region carved out of the empire rather than aiming for imperial dominance. Flavius Stilicho, the Vandal. Flavius Aetius, not a Hun but somebody who had been raised among the Huns and had _carte blanche_ to raise Hunnish armies—when he was not fighting Attila, that is. Alaric, King of the Visigoths and also Magister Militum per Illyricum. Theodoric the Amal, King of the Ostrogoths and also Magister Militium per Italiam.
