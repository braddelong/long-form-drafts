    "2. What does Aristotle say are the four tasks of the Greek man in managing his household? Why these four?\n",
    "3. What role do the “statues of Daedalus, [and] the tripods [robotic catering vessels] of Hephaestus” play in Aristotle’s argument about how the economy of his age is, must be, and should be structured? \n",
    "4. What role does Aristotle’s claim that “Of the art of acquisition [ktêtike] then there is one kind which by nature is a part of the management of a household…. There is another… commonly and rightly called an art of wealth-getting [chrêmatistikê]… [with] the notion that riches and property have no limit…” play in his argument? \n",
    "5. At the end of the first long paragraph of I.11, Aristotle writes: “Of the several divisions of wealth-getting I now speak generally; a minute consideration of them might be useful in practice, but it would be tiresome to dwell upon them at greater length now…” An alternative translation would say “detailed and exact discussion would be useful for the practical workings but to spend too much time on such things is crude…” (see Josiah Ober (2019): Agamemnon’s Cluelessness <https://delong.typepad.com/files/ober-agamemnon-1.pdf>). Aristotle considers knowledge of the art of wealth-getting “not unworthy of philosophy”, but spending your time practicing this art “illiberal an irksome”; philosophers should know how Thales of Miletos got rich by cornering the olive-press market on the island of Lesbos, but for Aristotle, his students, or his readers to dwell upon these matters at greater length would be “tiresome” or “crude”. What do you think is going on in Aristotle’s mind here?\n",
    "6. Did you find any advice—even indirect and oblique advice—from Aristotle in this passage about what the economic policy of a city-state should be? If so, what was it? If not, why do you think he fails to offer advice here (he offers lots of advice as to the organization and policies of city-states later on in the book)?\n",
    "7. Near the start of Book I Aristotle divided household management into four branches: (1) master-slave, (2) gender roles, (3) human reproduction, and acquiring material resources. he then skipped over (2) and (3) to talk about (1) and (4). Near the very end of the Book I, in I.12, he returns to (2) and (3). He says that “A husband and father, we saw, rules over wife and children, both free, but the rule differs, the rule over his children being a royal, over his wife a constitutional rule”. What is the distinction that you think Aristotle is drawing here? How important is it? (And do note that Aristoteles is here having an argument with Sokrates and Platon, who believed in gender equity: that the souls and thus “the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are…the same…”\n",
    "8. What does Aristotle conclude, at the end of the book, is the proper way to rank in importance the different branches of the art of household management?    \n",
